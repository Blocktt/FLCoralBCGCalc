# Purpose

Create an input file with the proper Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)
and attributes for each calculation. This function performs two steps to
the input file:

1.  "Translates" the original TaxonID to the proper OTU based on the
    selected calculation.

2.  Appends the Florida taxa attributes, which include phylogenetic data
    and traits. For corals, taxon-specific traits include BCG attribute
    assignments (BCG_ATTR), whether the taxon is 'Sometimes' or 'Never'
    weedy (WEEDY), whether the taxon is a 'Large Reef-Building Coral'
    (LRBC), and the Morphological Conversion Factor (MORPHCONVFACT)
    which is used to calculate Live tissue area on Colony Surface Area
    (LCSA).

The 'taxa translator' and attribute tables are based on reef
biomonitoring data from Florida reefs and will be updated regularly.

Translator, Taxa Attributes, and Metadata</a> from Github page (look for
files starting with "FLCoral_BCG\_". Note, that traits are not required
for each record (i.e., trait fields allow null values).

# Input File

There are multiple fields that the user is required to provide:

-   **SampleID** (Unique sample identifier; typically comprised of the
    site name, sample date, and replicate number.)

-   **TaxaID** (Unique taxa name.)

-   **TotTranLngth_M** (Juvenile colonies should be marked as 'TRUE'.)

-   **Juvenile** (Juvenile colonies should be marked as 'TRUE'.)

-   **DiamMax_cm** (Maximum diameter of the colony (cm).)

-   **DiamPerp_cm** (Perpendicular diameter of the colony (cm).)

-   **Height_cm** (Height of the colony (cm).)

-   **TotMort_pct** (% total mortality of the colony (e.g., 58%). Used
    to calculate % Living Tissue = 100 - TotMort_pct.)

SampleID and TaxaID will be used to match the input file with the taxa
translator table and attributes table. It is acceptable for your input
file to have these two fields named differently. Click on the drop-down
menus. The list of fields in your input file will appear. Select the
correct column headings.

Other required fields (i.e., TotTranLngth_M, Juvenile, etc.) and any
option fields that should be carried through into the output file (e.g.,
stationID, collection date, etc.) should be specified by clicking on the
'Columns to keep in output' box. The list of fields in your input file
will appear. Click on the fields that you want to include. If you change
your mind and want to remove a field, click on it and hit 'delete.'
[IMPORTANT]{.underline}: Do not add SampleID or TaxaID to this box as
they are already included from the drop-downs above.
