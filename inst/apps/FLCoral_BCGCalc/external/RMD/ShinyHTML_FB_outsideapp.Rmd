# Prepare an input file outside of the app

If you choose to create the input file outside of the app (versus using
the 'File Builder'), the comma-separated file (CSV) needs to have all
the required fields listed in the tables below depending on the
biological community. Column names must match the spelling, symbology
and capitalization scheme exactly as shown.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you are using the proper Operational Taxonomic Unit
(OTU) and taxa traits/attributes for your metric calculations. The Taxa
Translator and Attribute tables (and associated metadata) that were used
for BCG development can be downloaded from the
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools_SupportFiles/tree/main/data/taxa_official" target = "_blank">BioMonTools_SupportFiles</a>
GitHub page (look for files starting with "FLCoral_BCG\_". Note, that
traits are not required for each record (i.e., trait fields allow null
values).

# Data
fn_data <- "OutputFileSubtabs.xlsx"
path_data <- file.path("files", fn_data)
df_data <- read_excel(path_data, sheet = "FileBuild_OutsideCoral")

# Display
cap_data <- "Input file requirements for coral BCG model."
