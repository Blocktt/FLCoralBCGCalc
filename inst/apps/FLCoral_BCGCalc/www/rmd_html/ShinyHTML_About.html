<h1>Background</h1>
<p>This website calculates Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) scores
for coral samples reefs in Florida (Figure 1). The USEPA has published a
practitioner’s guide to BCG development that would be useful
introductory reading for someone new to the BCG framework
(<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-02/documents/bcg-practioners-guide-report.pdf" target="_blank">USEPA
2016</a>). A report on the development of the Florida Coral BCG models
is forthcoming.</p>

<h1>Intended application</h1>
<p>The FL Coral BCG improves the diagnostic ability of practitioners to
identify degradation in biological integrity and water quality. It is
intended to be applied to coral samples that meet the following
criteria:</p>
<p><strong>Geographic area</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Reef type</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Taxonomic resolution</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Collection gear and method</strong>:</p>
<p>For more information on sampling methodologies and application
limits, see the

Coral BCG development report</a>.</p>

<div id="coral-models" class="section level1">
<h1>Coral models</h1>
<p>Table 1 summarizes the Florida Coral BCG metrics, metric membership
rules, and level membership rules. Note, that Table 1 has two columns
for quantitative rules depending on the sampling agency (CREMP_KEYS or
NOT_CREMP_KEYS).</p>
